                               Regex flavors:
    Globs: * ? [...]                                    bash,    find
POSIX BRE:   . [...] ^ $ * \{,\} \(\) \1               (s)ed,    grep
  GNU BRE:   --------------------------- \? \+ \|      (s)ed,    grep
  GNU ERE:   ------------------------------------ no \ (s)ed -r, grep -E, awk
             \w \W \s \S \b \B \< \>
             Multiline: \` ^ $ \'

Notes: * POSIX [[:upper:]] will match according to the locale
         perl's one will match unicode chars
       * \d (not in BRE/ERE) is a shortcut for [[:digit:]] and is equivalent to [0-9] only faster
       * POSIX: \ cannot escape stuff in [...]
       * perl: The \d\s\w\D\S\W abbreviations can be used both inside and outside of character classes
